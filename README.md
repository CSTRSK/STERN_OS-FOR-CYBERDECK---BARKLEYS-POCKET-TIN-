## Project

**STERN OS** is a custom pocket cyberdeck built around an ESP32 and designed to fit inside a small **Barkleys tin**.
The goal of the project is to create a compact, fully custom handheld computer with its own keyboard, display, storage, games, terminal, file browser and other software features.
The entire project is built from scratch — including the electronics, custom PCB, keyboard, firmware and enclosure integration.

> **This is NOT an Altoids tin.**
> The project uses a Barkleys tin while keeping the compact metal-tin cyberdeck concept.

# Hardware

## Main Controller

**ESP32-WROOM / ESP32-DevKitC-32**

* Dual-core ESP32
* Wi-Fi
* Bluetooth
* USB Type-C
* CH340C USB-to-serial interface
  The ESP32 is the main processor responsible for running STERN OS and controlling the display, keyboard and peripherals.

## Custom Keyboard

The keyboard uses a dedicated **TCA8418RTWR — TCA8418** keyboard controller.

* QFN-24 package
* I²C keyboard controller
* Custom keyboard matrix
* Hardware diode per key
  Each key uses a **1N4148 SOD-323** diode.

## Display

The project uses a compact **2.4-inch TFT display** with an SPI interface.
The display module is based on an **ST7735 / ST7789** controller depending on the exact module revision.
Typical resolution:

* 240 × 320

## Power System

The power system is based around a **TPS63020** DC/DC buck-boost converter.

### Output

**3.3 V**
The converter provides the regulated 3.3 V supply required by the electronics.
Additional capacitors:

* 470 µF / 10 V bulk capacitor
* 10 µF 0603 X7R 10 V
* 100 nF 1206 50 V
  The main power switch is **SS12D11**.
  The power switch is placed in series with the battery supply so the entire system can be disconnected from the battery.

## FPC Interface

The project uses a **14-pin FPC connector** with:

* 0.5 mm pitch
* 14 contacts
* 10 cm FPC cable
  The project uses a specific FPC connector orientation, so the connector type must be selected carefully.

> **Important:** The first FPC connector purchased for the project turned out to be the wrong type/orientation. When reproducing the project, verify the connector orientation and contact direction before ordering.
> For easier prototyping and testing, a **14-pin FPC/FFC → 2.54 mm adapter** can also be used.

## PCB

The custom PCB for STERN OS was manufactured by **JLCPCB**.
The PCB integrates the electronics required by the cyberdeck and is designed around the extremely limited space available inside the Barkleys tin.
PCB production files and source design files will be provided in the `hardware` directory.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Software

STERN OS is developed using:

* C++
* ESP32
* PlatformIO
* Visual Studio Code
  The project is organized into multiple modules rather than keeping the entire operating system inside one source file.

---
# Applications

## Terminal

A built-in terminal interface for interacting with the system and accessing custom commands.

## File Browser

Allows files stored on the device to be browsed through a graphical interface.

## Text Editor

A lightweight text editor designed specifically for the pocket cyberdeck.

## Game of Life

A playable implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

## Dino Game

A small built-in arcade game.

## NES Emulator

An experimental NES emulator running on the ESP32.

## Settings

## System settings are managed through a dedicated graphical settings interface.

# Getting Started

## Requirements

* ESP32 development board
* PlatformIO
* Visual Studio Code
* USB Type-C cable
* STERN OS source code
